            <p class="aboutText leftText">I have always had a fondness for woodworking, having dabbled in various aspects of the art over the years. I first started to burn simple designs into wood using a soldering iron. One of my early projects was a bird box for a pet dove. The box had the initials of the lucky new tenant above the doorway, a very simple design, but one that got me interested in the art of woodburning (pyrography).<br><br>
            From this humble beginning PyroGFX came into being, I now enjoy burning cool looking designs into practical wooden items that can be used in day to day life. I try to choose designs that will appeal to a variety of different audiences, by including both original artwork from various artists, as well as pop culture icons. The end result being the creation of an item that serves a practical purpose, and looks awesome while doing so.</p>
            <p class="aboutText rightText hide">In addition to operating PyroGFX I am also a recent graduate of the University of Southern Queensland, having studied a bachelor of information technology, majoring in applied computer science. In my free time, when I'm not wood burning, programming, or mucking around with Linux, I can mostly be found cycling across various rugged terrains and mountains atop a mountain bike.</p>
